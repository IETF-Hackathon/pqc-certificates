# Seventh Sense (QuantCrypt) Artifacts

The artifacts in this directory are generated by the [QuantCrypt](https://crates.io/crates/QuantCrypt) cargo crate with documentation that can be found [here](https://docs.rs/QuantCrypt/0.2.0/quantcrypt/).

The QuantCrypt crate is a Rust implementation of an interface library that makes it easy to generate composite and pure PQC certificates and CMS enveloped content. 

## Generation of Certificates

To generate the certificates on your own, first clone the QuantCrypt repository and follow the instructions in the README.md file.

```
git clone https://github.com/codespree/quantcrypt
```

Artifacts in both [r3](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/pqc-certificates?tab=readme-ov-file#zip-format-r3---deprecated-will-be-removed-at-hackathon-in-november-2024) and [r4](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/pqc-certificates?tab=readme-ov-file#zip-format-r4) format are generated. They can be found in `artifacts/submission` folder.

## About Seventh Sense

[Seventh Sense](https://seventhsense.ai) is building a holistic security framework (SenseCrypt) designed to address the evolving challenges of digital security, centered around a privacy-preserving identity solution. At its core is the innovative SenseCrypt eID, which enables privacy-focused biometric verification without storage of biometric data. This GDPR-compliant foundational layer eliminates privacy risks and gives users full control over their identity and data. It sets the stage for a multi-tiered platform that enhances security at each level.

SenseCrypt also includes an innovative Face-based Public Key Infrastructure (Face PKI), which builds on well-established PKI frameworks (including PQC) by employing face-derived cryptographic key pairs. This enables diverse use cases such as proof of personhood, password-less login, multi-factor authentication (MFA), encryption, and document signing. It also significantly improves key management, enhances non-repudiation, mitigates risks associated with static key storage, and ensures the right user is conducting the transaction, all while safeguarding user privacy.
